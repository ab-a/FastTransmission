# FastTransmission

A little shell script to install and configure automatically `Transmission Torrent` (include `vsftpd` installation).

```
$ chmod +x init.sh
# ./init.sh
```

Then go to http://your-ip:9091

The user is `td` (for transmission downloader) and the download directory is `/home/td/downloads`. 

Simple !
